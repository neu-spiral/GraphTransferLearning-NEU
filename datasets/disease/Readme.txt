In assent.txt, you will find the role of the corresponding ids. 

weightedEdgeList.txt has the following format:

id1	id2	interaction_duration

Where id1 and id2 refer to a unique identifier. Multiple interactions between the same ids mean that the motes were in close proximity multiple times during the day.
